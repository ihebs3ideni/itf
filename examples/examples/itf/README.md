# The example application on a container, a DLT target and a QEMU machine

| Test | Target | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| `example_app` | `targets/docker/` by default, `targets/qemu/` when building for QNX (`--config=qemu-integration`) | one test file on two machines, the target picked by a `select()` |
| `dlt` | `targets/dlt/` | a target's DLT logs received by the session; the project's policy starts dlt-daemon |

`targets/policy.py`, above the target directories, is shared by all three: readiness checks, evidence, the
dlt-daemon action. `bazel build //examples/itf:target_docker` compiles a target file without starting anything.
