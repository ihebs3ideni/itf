# A vendor's own contract

Acme sells a power relay and wants tests, its customers' and its own, to switch it the same way whatever the
hardware. It defines a contract, `acme/power.relay`, and ships it. **Nothing registers the name**: a contract is
whatever name two parts agree on. ITF is the platform that lets Acme define it, check it and map it.

```
acme_pack/                      what Acme ships
  acme/
    pack.yaml                   the pack's name: acme
    plugin.py                   the pack's entrypoint module
    providers.py                a factory fulfilling acme/power.relay (a simulation)
    contracts/power.yaml        the definition: meaning, members, version, stability, role, conformance
    conformance.py              the checks every factory claiming the contract must pass
target.itf.yaml                 a composition with the relay as the role `power`
conftest.py                     the project's own part: a status LED, contract `bench/led`, never defined
test_relay.py                   tests that require the roles
test_conformance.py             runs the vendor's checks against the part that claims the contract
```

## 1. The factory says what it fulfils

```python
@capability("acme/power.relay@1")
def simulated_relay() -> SimulatedRelay:
    return SimulatedRelay()
```

The decorator is the one place that says which contract, and which major, the factory fulfils. The label is the
pack plus the function name: `acme.simulated_relay`. What the factory publishes (`on`, `off`, `is_on`, `toggle`)
is read from its return annotation. A factory for real hardware fulfils the same contract; the tests do not change.

## 2. The definition is optional, and the vendor's

`acme_pack/acme/contracts/power.yaml` gives the contract meaning: summary, members with signatures, guarantees,
`version: 1`, `stability: experimental`, a suggested `role: power`, and `conformance: acme.conformance`. `toggle`
is `required: false`: a factory may omit it, and a test that needs it says so with `shape`. Without this file
the composition still compiles: wiring and gating use the names and the shapes the parts publish and expect. A
definition adds meaning, versions and conformance.

A pack's definitions live in its own `contracts/` directory. ITF also reads the directories of
`ITF_CONTRACTS_PATH`, which `py_itf_test(contracts = [...])` sets (this example), and distributions with a
`score_itf.contracts` entry point.

## Where the pack comes from

ITF's own packs are found by name. A pack that is not installed is located by the composition itself, in one
explicit line:

```yaml
packs:
  acme: acme.plugin
```

Once Acme publishes its pack as a distribution with a `score_itf.packs` entry point, that line can go.

## 3. A composition and a test use the role

```yaml
packs:
  acme: acme.plugin
capabilities:
  power: acme.simulated_relay
  led: project.status_led
```

```python
@itf.requires("power", contract="acme/power.relay@1", shape=["on", "off", "is_on"])
def test_the_relay_switches(target):
    target.power.on()
    assert target.power.is_on()
```

`@1` pins the major (a test that asks for another is deselected with the reason). `shape=["toggle"]` gates a
test on the optional member. Swapping the simulation for a real relay is changing the factory label.

## 4. The vendor's checks

`conformance.py` is written like ITF's own (`score/itf/contracts/conformance/`): `@check()` functions that take
the offered object and call `expect`, collected in `CHECKS` keyed by the contract name. `:conformance` runs them
against every part of the target that claims `acme/power.relay`: the simulation here, a customer's hardware
factory in their pipeline.

## 5. See what is in use

```
itf contracts map target.itf.yaml                          # text; add --json for tools
itf contracts new acme/power.relay --from-usage target.itf.yaml
itf contracts check --policy policy.yaml target.itf.yaml   # exit 1 on violations
```

For this target the map shows two contracts that matter here:

| Contract | Offered by (shape) | Needed by | Tests | Defined |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `acme/power.relay` | `acme.simulated_relay` (`is_on`, `off`, `on`, `toggle`) | none | `test_the_relay_switches`, `test_the_optional_toggle` | yes, `acme/contracts/power.yaml` |
| `bench/led` | `project.status_led` (`light`, `lit`) | none | `test_a_contract_without_a_definition` | no |

Any disagreement (a test requiring a member no offerer has, two definitions of one name, a major nobody offers)
is listed under its contract. `contracts new` writes the skeleton for `bench/led` from the shapes observed, if
the project later wants it defined. A policy (`policy.yaml`) can require definitions for a namespace, fix a role to a contract (the role `power` is
always an `acme/power.relay`) and forbid stabilities:

```yaml
namespaces:
  - acme/power
roles:
  power: acme/power.relay
forbid_stability:
  - deprecated
```

```
bazel test //examples/vendor_contract:test //examples/vendor_contract:conformance     # from examples/
bazel build //examples/vendor_contract:target                                         # target.plan.json
```
