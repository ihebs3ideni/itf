Architecture
============

ITF composes a test target from declarations instead of coding it as a class. Three layers, each
depending only on the one below:

.. code-block:: text

   pytest adapter      score/itf/core/adapters/pytest   discovery, gating, bring-up, fixtures
   ITF core            score/itf/core                   session, realization, probes, execution,
                                                         unwind, the composition format
   OCTO                score/itf/core/octo               the planner: pure standard library

Packs (``score/itf/packs``) and a project's own parts (its root ``conftest.py``) depend on the core's public
API only, and never on each other. Gates in ``//test/core:gates_test`` keep OCTO free of imports and both
OCTO and the core free of domain words (``ssh``, ``docker``, ``dlt``, ...): domain code lives in packs.

Contracts instead of a target class
-----------------------------------

A *capability contract* (``exec.command``) is fulfilled by a *capability factory* (``@capability``, label
``docker.exec``); a composition places it under a *role* (``command``), and a test uses it as
``target.command``. A *state contract* (``platform.up``) is fulfilled by an *action* (``@state``, label
``docker.start``) with a probe that checks it. Docker and QEMU are two packs of ``platform.instance``: a test
written against ``command`` runs on either. To the planner every name is an opaque string; ITF knows no
contracts (see :doc:`model`).

Packs never share code. A factory publishes the shape of what it returns; a consumer (another factory's slot,
an action, a test's ``@itf.requires(..., shape=...)``) states the members it needs with its own Protocol. OCTO
compares the two at every seam.

Two gates
---------

Before any test is collected, OCTO resolves:

1. **Gate 1, what must exist**: factories bound to roles, slots bound, shapes checked, settings validated,
   construction order.
2. **Gate 2, what must happen**: from the goals, the actions to run and their order, from ``after`` (what must
   hold first) and ``breaks`` (what an action destroys). Probes run first, so the plan is the delta from what
   already holds. Actions sharing an implementation collapse into one step that verifies each state with its
   own probe.

A failure is one diagnostic naming the gate, not hundreds of red tests. ``itf validate``, ``itf plan`` and
``--itf-plan`` stop here.

Lifecycle
---------

.. code-block:: text

   load packs from labels → register → publish → compile composition → gate 1 → probe → gate 2
        → select (gating) → bring-up (execute, verify probes) → itf_verify → tests → itf_teardown → unwind

Roles are realized lazily: a deselected test's capabilities are never built. State changes only through the
planner: ``session.reach(state)`` and ``session.renew(role)``, the latter dismantling a role and its dependents,
then reaching the goals again.

Bazel integration
-----------------

``itf_target`` compiles a composition in a build action and writes its plan. ``py_itf_test(target = ...)`` builds
a ``py_test`` that loads the ITF adapter, the packs the target names, and the composition and its override files
(``ITF_TARGET`` and ``ITF_OVERRIDE``); ``$(location)`` in ``env`` is expanded. Packs ship their tools (dlt-receive,
tcpdump) as Bazel-built data found through runfiles. Run artifacts go to ``$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR/itf-run``.

ITF does not ship the original ``Target`` API; a project keeps old tests running with its own facade over the
packs (``examples/examples/legacy``); see :doc:`../how-to/migrate`.
